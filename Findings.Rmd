## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data}
summary(data_day)
summary(data_hour)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
# Task One: Load and explore the data

### Importing file
#day_data<-read.csv("D:/Desktop/Data_Analyst/Project/day.csv")
#hour_data<-read.csv("D:/Desktop/Data_Analyst/Project/hour.csv")




```{r}
## Import required packages
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("forecast")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("zoo")

```


## Describe and explore the data

```{r}
# Check structure and summary
str(day_data)
summary(day_data)

str(hour_data)
summary(hour_data)
```



# Task Two: Create interactive time series plots

```{r}

# Plot the smoothed data time series
ggplot(data_hour, aes(x = dteday)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = cnt), color = "blue", alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = cnt_smoothed), color = "red", size = 1) + 
  labs(
    x = "Time",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Time Series with Exponential Smoothing"
  )

# column is in Date format
data_day$dteday <- as.Date(data_day$dteday)

# Plot the data with moving average smoothing
ggplot(data_day, aes(x = dteday)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = cnt), color = "blue", alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = cnt_smoothed), color = "red", size = 1) + 
  labs(
    x = "Date",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Time Series with Moving Average Smoothing (data_day)"
  )

```




# Task Three: Smooth time series data

```{r}
data_hour$cnt_smoothed <- stats::filter(data_hour$cnt, filter = rep(1/7, 7), sides = 2)

# Plot the smoothed data time series
ggplot(data_hour, aes(x = dteday)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = cnt), color = "blue", alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = cnt_smoothed), color = "red", size = 1) + 
  labs(
    x = "Time",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Time Series with Exponential Smoothing"
  )

# column is in Date format
data_day$dteday <- as.Date(data_day$dteday)

# Plot the data with moving average smoothing
ggplot(data_day, aes(x = dteday)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = cnt), color = "blue", alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = cnt_smoothed), color = "red", size = 1) + 
  labs(
    x = "Date",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Time Series with Moving Average Smoothing (data_day)"
  )

```



# Task Four: Decompse and access the stationarity of time series data

```{r}
library(zoo)
data_day$cnt <- zoo::na.approx(data_day$cnt)

# Create time series object again
data_day_ts <- ts(data_day$cnt, frequency = 365, start = c(2011, 1))

# Forward fill (replace NA with previous value)
data_day$cnt <- zoo::na.locf(data_day$cnt)

# Backward fill (replace NA with next value)
data_day$cnt <- zoo::na.locf(data_day$cnt, fromLast = TRUE)

# Decompose the cleaned time series
decomposed_data <- decompose(data_day_ts)
plot(decomposed_data)
```



# Task Five: Fit and forecast time series data using ARIMA models

```{r}
adf.test(data_day_ts)

# Fit the ARIMA model to the time series
arima_model <- auto.arima(data_day_ts)

# View the fitted model
summary(arima_model)

# Forecast the next 10 periods
forecasted_values <- forecast(arima_model, h = 10)

# View the forecasted values
print(forecasted_values)

# Plot the forecast
plot(forecasted_values)

# Forecasted values
forecasted_values$mean

# Lower and upper bounds of the forecast confidence interval
forecasted_values$lower
forecasted_values$upper

# Perform Ljung-Box test for residuals
Box.test(residuals(arima_model), lag = 25, type = "Ljung-Box")

adf.test(data_day_ts)

# Fit the ARIMA model to the time series
arima_model <- auto.arima(data_day_ts)

# View the fitted model
summary(arima_model)

# Forecast the next 10 periods
forecasted_values <- forecast(arima_model, h = 10)

# View the forecasted values
print(forecasted_values)

# Plot the forecast
plot(forecasted_values)

# Forecasted values
forecasted_values$mean

# Lower and upper bounds of the forecast confidence interval
forecasted_values$lower
forecasted_values$upper

# Perform Ljung-Box test for residuals
Box.test(residuals(arima_model), lag = 25, type = "Ljung-Box")


```



# Task Six: Findings and Conclusions

# Firstly data has been cleaned by using box plot and has removed outliers.
#Therefore, we can conclude that the time series of data_hour is stationary. and not stationary for data_dayr. So differencing is necessary for day data to be stationary for arima model to predict future trends correctly.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
